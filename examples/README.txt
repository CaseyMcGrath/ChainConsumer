ChainConsumer can, at this point in time, do several distinct, useful tasks.
The primary one is to create the likelihood surfaces and marginalised
distributions that should be familiar. ChainConsumer can also plot
the chains as walks to check convergence and mixing. Additionally, ChainConsumer
can output LaTeX ready tables of parameter summaries that can be
copied and pasted directly into a TeX document, or similar LaTeX tables
with parameter correlation, covariance or inter-model comparisons using AIC, BIC and DIC.
