# Guide for contributing!

1. Please read over the online documentation, or use GitHub discussions to chat if you're unsure about anything.
2. Fork the repo + clone it out
3. I highly recommend either a nix system or using the Windows Subsystem for Linux
4. Install a developer version by running (in the directory you just cloned into): `make install`
   1. This should install poetry, dependencies, and a pre-commit hook
   2. Verify it all looks good by running `make precommit`
5. Code!
